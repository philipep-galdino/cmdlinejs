# SuperInit
A Javascript Command Line Interface for a better init of a Git Repository. WIP


This idea is from https://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-command-line-interface-cli-node-js/ with some personnel modifications I made while learning about the use of some modules presented along with a better quality coding with Javascript.
